# Constructive PNPM

PNPM workspace management, package publishing, and monorepo best practices for Constructive projects.

## When to Apply

Use this skill when:
- Configuring pnpm workspaces and monorepo settings
- Publishing TypeScript packages to npm with makage and lerna
- Managing workspace dependencies and cross-package references
- Setting up the dist-folder publishing pattern
- Understanding deep nested imports vs `exports` map (anti-pattern)

## Key Concepts

### Dist-Folder Publishing (TypeScript/JS Only)

Constructive publishes **TypeScript/JS packages** from the `dist/` folder, which becomes the package root on npm. This means:
- `main: "index.js"` points to `dist/index.js` after publish
- Consumers never see `dist/` in their import paths
- No `exports` field needed — standard Node.js resolution works
- Uses `makage build` to compile TypeScript and copy assets to `dist/`
- `publishConfig.directory: "dist"` in package.json

**This does NOT apply to pgpm SQL modules.** PGPM modules publish from the package root (no `dist/` folder, no makage). They use `pgpm package` to bundle SQL files instead. See the `pgpm` skill ([publishing.md](../pgpm/references/publishing.md)) for the SQL module publishing workflow.

### Deep Nested Imports (NOT `exports` Map)

**NEVER use the `exports` map pattern.** Instead, use deep nested imports via file paths:

```typescript
// Correct: deep nested import (works because dist/ becomes package root)
import { OrmClient } from '@my-org/sdk/api';
import { generateOrm } from '@constructive-io/graphql-codegen/core/codegen/orm';

// WRONG: exports map anti-pattern
// "exports": { "./api": { "import": "./dist/api/index.js" } }
```

See [pnpm-publishing.md](./references/pnpm-publishing.md) for the full explanation.
