# Plans

Plans are blueprints and proposals for future work. They capture design thinking before it becomes a formal contract.

## Characteristics

- **Iterative**: Plans evolve through discussion and refinement
- **Exploratory**: May contain open questions and alternatives
- **Not authoritative**: Plans are not contracts—they do not define expected behavior for tests or reviewers

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Draft | Initial proposal, still being shaped |
| In Review | Under active review by stakeholders |
| Accepted | Approved for implementation |
| Rejected | Not moving forward |

## Promotion

When a plan is accepted, it is promoted into `docs/spec/`.

The plan file may be archived or removed after promotion. The spec becomes the authoritative reference.

## Creating a Plan

1. Copy `template.plan.md` to a new file (e.g., `my-feature.plan.md`)
2. Fill in the required sections
3. Submit for review via PR
4. Iterate based on feedback
5. Once accepted, promote to spec
